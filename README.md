# section_scroll
Javascript to change active menu item based on scroll position related to
sections of the page.

## This is just a sample code!
It won't work by just copying and pasting the code into the website.

### What you need to do before using
Make sure that the menu items and the sections have correspondent ids as
mentioned in the code comments.

Change the [section_identifier] placeholder to some class that identifies your
sections.
